# Crime Hotspot Detection — Ottawa

## Overview
This project analyzes historical crime incident data to identify hotspot patterns across Ottawa. The work focuses on data preparation, exploratory analysis, and machine learning model evaluation to understand factors associated with higher crime risk.

## Project Type
**Group academic project** completed collaboratively as part of a Machine Learning course.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess crime incident data
- Explore feature-based and spatial patterns related to crime risk
- Train and evaluate machine learning models
- Summarize findings through analysis and reporting

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## My Contribution
This was a group project. My contributions included:
- Data preprocessing and feature preparation
- Model evaluation and interpretation of results
- Supporting analysis and documentation of findings

## Report & Presentation

- **Presentation Slides:** `slides/ottawa_crime_hotspot_presentation.pptx`

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in the `notebooks` folder
2. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and modeling
